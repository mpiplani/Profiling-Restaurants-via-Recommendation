# DSCI-553-Project

### Description
The outbreak of COVID-19 has disrupted the food industry. There has been a decline in the number of people visiting restaurants. Moreover, they have started ordering food online. The restaurant owners are facing fear and are not able to make firm decisions due to these unpredictable times. Few operational restaurants are facing financial constraints and losses. Our motivation is to help restaurant owners decide which dishes to add to the menu, and also optimize the path to procure ingredients for the dishes to maximize profit.


### Hypothesis
According to the study, the restaurant owners are facing issues procuring stock for the dishes on the menu. The study also highlights the difficulty in deciding due to the unpredictability of the outcomes of the pandemic.
Our work focuses on increasing profit by giving importance to factors like menu size and money spent on the procurement of ingredients for the dishes.
We believe that adding the top-rated dishes according to the cuisine and neighborhood in the menu and only preparing for these dishes can save a lot of money and resources. We also focus on finding a supplier at COVID safe locations to minimize health risks.
